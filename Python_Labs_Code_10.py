#LAB-10 Preparing to Analyze Insulin with Python

# Bonus: Cleaning preproinsulin-seq.txt programmatically
# # Cleaning source data files is a common task in 
# computer programming. You could programmatically clean preproinsulin-seq.txt 
# in several waysâ€”for example, by using Bash, Python, or another programming 
# language of choice. 
# Try using regex to 
# programmatically strip the file of ORIGIN, 
# its numbers, 
# the two slashes (//), 
# spaces, and 
# line breaks or return carriages. 
# You could also confirm programmatically 
# that the file has 110 characters.
